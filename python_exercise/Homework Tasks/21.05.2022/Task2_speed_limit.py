#  implement a speed limit alert function for drivers in Estonia using their Distance and time.
# Note: Formula for Speed = Distance รท Time. the program takes as input the distance and time.
# if speed limit is between 0 - 20km/h show message "You are driving slow"
# if speed limit is between 21 - 45km/h show message "You are driving with the limit for inner streets"
# if speed limit is between 46 - 70km/h show message "You are driving faster. watch out for speed bumps"
# if speed limit is between 71 - 100km/h show message "You are driving very fast. Ensure you use your seat belt"
# if speed limit is above 100km/h show message "You are driving recklessly and putting your life at risk"
