Therefore, don't worry if some things seem to you to be black magic! We have to start somewhere.\n",

    "In the presented example, we try to solve the problem of classification of grayscale images representing handwritten digits (these images have a resolution of 28x28 pixels). We want to divide them into 10 categories (numbers from 0 to 9). We will use the MNIST dataset, which is recognized by the analyst community as a classic dataset. It exists as long as the history of machine learning is long. This collection contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. It was established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the 1980s. The solution to this problem can be compared to the display of the words \"Hello world!\" while learning a new programming language. This set is also used to check that the algorithm is working properly. If you start working professionally with machine learning, you will find that the MNIST set appears repeatedly in various scientific papers, articles published on the Internet, and so on. Figure 2.1 shows some of the elements of that set.\n"
